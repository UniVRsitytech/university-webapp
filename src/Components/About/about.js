                        When students and tutors are forced to choose between in-person vs online tutoring they have to choose between cost vs. value.
                        But through Virtual Reality tutoring will be both affordable and engaging. <br />
                        <br />
                        We at UniVRsity are developing the first VR tutoring application where students and
                        tutors can meet in a common room and engage in content using our interactive tools and experiences.<br />
                        <br />
