What stopped him from pursuing those offers was his belief in UniVRsity’s mission and potential impact. He could not have the project sit idle over the summer. Thus he declined all his offers, formed a team and immersed himself in Cornell’s entrepreneurship community. Nicolas will be graduating in three years in order to be able to fully focus on the development of UniVRsity.",
